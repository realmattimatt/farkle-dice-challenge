## **Project Overview**

**Farkle-Simulator** is a terminal-based, multi-player dice game inspired by the classic game *Farkle*. This project was designed as a fun, interactive way to apply object-oriented programming concepts, scoring algorithms, and terminal animations using Python.

The game features animated ASCII dice rolls, turn-based logic, real-time scoring, and a final scoreboard â€” all within a Python console environment. Players aim to be the first to reach 10,000 points by rolling strategically and choosing when to bank their scores.

## **Features**

- ðŸŽ² **ASCII Animated Dice Rolls** â€“ Simulates realistic, rolling dice animation in the console.
- ðŸ’¥ **Custom Scoring System** â€“ Recognizes combinations like straights, triplets, three pairs, and more.
- ðŸ”„ **Hot Dice Mechanic** â€“ Roll all six dice again if every die is part of a scoring combination.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Live Leaderboard** â€“ Round-by-round scoreboard and current rankings displayed after each turn.
- ðŸ‘¥ **Multi-Player Support** â€“ Add as many players as you like with unique names.
- ðŸ§  **Scoring Breakdown** â€“ Shows how each roll scored, with labeled combinations.
- ðŸ§® **Risk vs. Reward Gameplay** â€“ Keep rolling to score more, but Farkle and lose it all!

## **Technologies / Dependencies Needed and Used**

- **Python 3.x**
- Built-in modules only:
